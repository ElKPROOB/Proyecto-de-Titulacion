### **Allearning** is a practical learning tool, created to facilitate the teaching of programming and oriented to the competitive field due to the small amount of applications or courses that teach this programming field.

### In general, few schools teach basic programming or something related to it. Therefore, this application is focused on users who want to enter in the world of programming, develop without any difficulty and, in the future, apply the knowledge acquired in a job that requires it.

### It was created in a context of pandemic by the Club de Algoritmia of the [*Center of Scientific and Technological Studies N°13*](https://www.cecyt13.ipn.mx/), from students for students.

### It consists of different graphic lessons about basic programming topics, accompanied by some quizzes that encourage the student to test the acquired knowledge.

### Allearning's philosophy is to teach slowly but surely, with a distribution of knowledge in small segments. In order for students to practice what they learn step by step, and to be able to refer back to specific knowledge when they need it.

## Authors

We are a small group of young people who want to try to help some students in the career of computer science to improve their knowledge in programming, not only to students of the career, but to people who also want to have principles in programming and can start learning without any classroom course and from the comfort of their home.
